CALC, which stands for Contracts Awarded Labor Category, is a tool to help contracting personnel estimate their per-hour labor costs for a contract, based on historical pricing information. The tool is live at [https://calc.gsa.gov](https://calc.gsa.gov). You can track our progress or file an issue on this repo.

## Documentation

The most readable version of the project's developer documentation
can be found at
[calc.gsa.gov/docs/](https://calc.gsa.gov/docs/).

However, if that doesn't work for some reason, the documentation is
also available in this repository's [docs](docs/) directory.

To get started developing CALC, you'll probably want to start with either the
[Setup guide](docs/setup.md) or the [Docker setup guide](docs/docker.md),
depending on your preference. 

To get started with the CALC APIs, you can jump straight to the 
[CALC API documentation](https://calc-dev.app.cloud.gov/api/docs/)
